Code Functionality - utils.py

    Initialization:
        Sets up OpenAI and Elasticsearch API configurations.
        Initializes logging for debugging and monitoring.

    Token Counting:
        Uses the tiktoken library to estimate token counts for queries.

    Embedding Retrieval:
        Retrieves embeddings from the OLLAMA API, handling errors gracefully.

    Elasticsearch Data Fetching:
        Uses aggregations to fetch hierarchical data (supercategories, categories, subcategories).
        Performs vector searches to find the most relevant examples.

    Classification:
        Generates a structured prompt, either with or without vector search examples.
        Uses a hierarchical structure to ensure accurate classification.

    Output:
        Returns the most relevant supercategory, category, and subcategory, along with elapsed processing time.

Key Observations

    Error Handling:
        The code effectively handles errors, such as failed requests or Elasticsearch issues, with meaningful logging.

    Hierarchical Structure:
        The hierarchical classification ensures that the system selects the most relevant category and subcategory.

    Prompt Design:
        Prompts are detailed and provide clear instructions to the model, ensuring structured responses.



API Documentation - api.py

Overview

This Flask-based application provides various API endpoints to manage user registration, login, classification tasks, and memory storage using Elasticsearch. It incorporates JWT authentication for security, Redis for caching and rate-limiting, and Elasticsearch for storing and querying classified data.
